## Marvelous Bacon Sensation

## Description
Have you ever just been feeling a mood and wanting to sink further down into it? The Vibe-Check-er-ator is a simple web app that will allow you to enter your current mood (aka vibe) and then receive some media suggestions to keep riding the wave of your current vibe. 

## Installation
Clone this repository and open html, js, and css files in code editor. View website at https://mpkahn.github.io/thevibe/. Images in assets folder.

## Usage
Open https://mpkahn.github.io/thevibe/ and view the vibe bar in the center. Enter your current mood/vibe and hit the "Vibez" button. 

From there you will see three pieces of media generate! A youtube link with a video related to your vibe, a book suggestion that will link you to google books if you click on the title, and a gif that relates to your current mood. 

If you have had enough of your curren vibes, you can enter another word into the vibe bar and hit "vibez" to generate new content. All your previous vibe queries are stored in local storage and listed on the page. Your vibe searches should show a variety of content, even if your mood is the same!
